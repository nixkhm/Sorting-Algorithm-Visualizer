# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer

A visualizer where numbers in an array are represented by bars with varying heights to demonstrate the steps of various sorting algorithms

# Features

* The sorting algorithms featured are Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort
* Randomly generated arrays and the option to create new arrays
* Demonstrations consist of bars changing colors to show comparisons and scope of the algorithms

# What I Learned

* Implementing sorting algorithms and acknowledging each step in their respective processes as well as the scope these steps
* Using a Promise Object to set delays within the steps to distinguish each one clearly
* Performing swaps for different algorthms based on comparisons as well as demonstarting those swaps with different colored bars
